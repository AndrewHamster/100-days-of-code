# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 06, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started new android project with MVP architecture

**Thoughts:** MVP is quite strange for me, as my previous experience was only with MVVM (google samples help a lot :D)
BTW, that repository in architecture is a great idea - definitely will use in next projects

**Link to work:** [Repository](https://github.com/AndrewHamster/todo-app-mvp)
