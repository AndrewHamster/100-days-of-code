# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 06, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started new android project with MVP architecture

**Thoughts:** MVP is quite strange for me, as my previous experience was only with MVVM (google samples help a lot :D)
BTW, that repository in architecture is a great idea - definitely will use in next projects

### Day 1: January 07, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added tasks list, learned a bit how to use diffutils, handler and styling

**Thoughts:** Now MVP seems as a pretty reasonable way of organizing your app - no additional dependencies, clear separation of concerns.
Definitely need more practice with java multithreading. Probably going to spend some time tomorrow reading about it.
