# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 06, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started new android project with MVP architecture

**Thoughts:** MVP is quite strange for me, as my previous experience was only with MVVM (google samples help a lot :D)
BTW, that repository in architecture is a great idea - definitely will use in next projects

### Day 1: January 07, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added tasks list, learned a bit how to use diffutils, handler and styling

**Thoughts:** Now MVP seems as a pretty reasonable way of organizing your app - no additional dependencies, clear separation of concerns.
Definitely need more practice with java multithreading. Probably going to spend some time tomorrow reading about it.

### Day 2: January 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added activity and fragment for task detail, learned a bit how to handle navigation in mvp

**Thoughts:** Feel not that much excited as before, but practice makes perfect. Finally holidays are over. Back to work :D

### Day 3: January 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Implemented navigation

**Thoughts:** Need to learn how to handle lifecycle.

### Day 4: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned about ways to handle lifecycle. Not that much code - few lines trying to tackle lifecycle problems.

**Thoughts:** Right now for me there is no obvious way to handle configuration change, only robust caching mechanism can help.
Next thing to do is to add ability to create tasks and store them. Looking towards Room.
